    <h2>Disease-Causing Agent: Norovirus</h2>
    <p>
      Norovirus is a highly contagious viral pathogen responsible for causing gastroenteritis, which is inflammation of the stomach and intestines.
    </p>

    <h2>Transmission: Norovirus</h2>
    <p>
      Norovirus spreads primarily through the ingestion of contaminated food or water. It can also be transmitted through contact with infected surfaces or direct person-to-person contact.
    </p>

    <h2>Symptoms: Norovirus</h2>
    <p>
      Norovirus infection leads to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, and sometimes low-grade fever. The symptoms usually begin within 12 to 48 hours after exposure to the virus.
    </p>

    <h2>Treatment/Management: Norovirus</h2>
    <p>
      There is no specific antiviral treatment for norovirus infection. Management primarily involves rehydration to prevent dehydration and the use of over-the-counter medications to alleviate symptoms.
    </p>

    <h2>Control: Norovirus</h2>
    <p>
      Preventing norovirus outbreaks involves implementing strict hygiene measures, including proper handwashing with soap and water, disinfecting surfaces, and practicing food safety protocols in food preparation and handling.
    </p>

    <h2>Prognosis: Norovirus</h2>
    <p>
      Norovirus infections are usually self-limiting and resolve within a few days without long-term consequences. However, in vulnerable populations like the elderly and young children, complications may arise due to dehydration.
