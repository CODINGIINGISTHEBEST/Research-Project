    <h2>Disease-Causing Agent: Autism</h2>
    <p>
      Autism, also known as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder. It is characterized by difficulties in social communication and interaction, as well as repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities.
    </p>

    <h2>Transmission: Autism</h2>
    <p>
      Autism is not a disease caused by pathogens, and it is not contagious. Instead, it is considered a developmental condition that has a strong genetic basis and is influenced by various environmental factors.
    </p>

    <h2>Symptoms: Autism</h2>
    <p>
      Autism can present a wide range of symptoms, and individuals with ASD may experience challenges in social communication, such as difficulties in understanding social cues, maintaining eye contact, and engaging in reciprocal conversations. Additionally, repetitive behaviors and a preference for sameness are common features of autism.
    </p>

    <h2>Treatment/Management: Autism</h2>
    <p>
      While there is no cure for autism, various therapies and interventions can help individuals with ASD develop essential skills and manage their challenges effectively. Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), speech therapy, occupational therapy, and social skills training are some of the common approaches used to support individuals with autism.
    </p>

    <h2>Control: Autism</h2>
    <p>
      Autism cannot be "controlled" in the traditional sense, as it is a developmental condition. However, early diagnosis and intervention can lead to significant improvements in communication, behavior, and overall quality of life for individuals with autism.
    </p>

    <h2>Prognosis: Autism</h2>
    <p>
      Autism is a lifelong condition, and its prognosis varies depending on the individual's level of support and intervention. Many individuals with autism can lead fulfilling lives and make valuable contributions to society with the right support and understanding.
    </p>

    <h2>The prevalence of the disease in Australia and globally</h2>
    <p>In Australia, the prevalence of autism has been on the rise in recent years. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the most recent data from 2021 indicates that approximately 1 in 150 Australians is diagnosed with autism. It is crucial to note that these numbers may vary slightly depending on the data source and diagnostic criteria used.
